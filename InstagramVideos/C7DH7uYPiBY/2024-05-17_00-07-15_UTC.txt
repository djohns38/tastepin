This Australian phenomenon just hit NYC, and it‚Äôs one of the most talked about new spots to open this year. We went in with some skepticism, but we were impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the portions for the price (~$16 per bowl). Definitely a great option for grab-and-go lunch (once the lines calm down) or quick weeknight bite üìç THISBOWL (NoHo, Manhattan) @thisbowl_nyc
