NYC’s only Michelin-starred Indian restaurant, but in our opinion, there should be more. Even just this year, there have been some great new spots like Kanyakumari and Bungalow, on top of an already strong scene including Indian Accent, and other Unapologetic Foods stars like Adda and Dhamaka 📍 Semma (West Village, Manhattan)
