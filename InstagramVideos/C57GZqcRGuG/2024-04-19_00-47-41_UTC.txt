This is New York’s top rated restaurant, but food critics won’t admit it. We pulled the numbers, and this spot averages an incredible 9.6 out of 10 (higher than any other restaurant in the city), but it has received no major awards, and very little positive attention from the media 🤷‍♀️ 📍4 Charles Prime Rib (West Village, Manhattan) @nycprimerib
