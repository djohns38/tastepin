Trying the no. 1 rated croissant in Paris, based on 30 million ratings on Beli. We went twice, and highly recommend going in the morning when they are fresh (even though they are open until 8pm). At 1.40 euros ($1.50), they also put US prices to shame 📍 La Maison d’Isabelle (Paris, France) @maison_isabelle_paris
