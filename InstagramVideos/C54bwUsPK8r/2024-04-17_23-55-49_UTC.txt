Named the number 1 restaurant on the New York Times 100 Best Restaurants in New York City in 2023 and 2024, we agree that this spot is special. It has one of the most fun and creative menus we‚Äôve ever seen, and each dish is filled with nostalgia and love for the city üìç Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi (Lincoln Center, Manhattan) @tatianabychefkwame
